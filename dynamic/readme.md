# **dynamic malware detection in a runtime environment using Machine Learning** 

---

### **1. Data Collection (Runtime Monitoring)**

* **System Call Tracing**: Capture sequences of system calls (e.g., file access, registry changes, network requests).
* **API Call Monitoring**: Record Windows/Linux API calls invoked by processes.
* **Process & Thread Behavior**: Track process creation, memory allocation, thread injection, etc.
* **Network Activity**: Observe outgoing connections, DNS queries, and packet patterns.
* **File/Registry Operations**: Monitor modifications, deletions, and hidden persistence attempts.

---

### **2. Feature Extraction & Representation**

* Convert raw runtime logs into **numerical features** suitable for ML:

  * **Frequency features**: Count of each API/system call.
  * **Sequential patterns**: N-grams of system/API calls.
  * **Graph representations**: System call dependency graphs.
  * **Statistical features**: Average CPU, memory, network usage.

---

### **3. Data Preprocessing**

* Normalize feature values.
* Apply **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, autoencoders) if feature space is large.
* Label data as **benign** or **malicious** based on ground truth (from sandbox or threat intelligence).

---

### **4. Model Training**

* Train ML models using extracted features:

  * **Classical ML**: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost.
  * **Deep Learning**: LSTM/GRU (for sequence data), CNN (for call sequence patterns), GNN (for call graphs).
* Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

---

### **5. Runtime Detection (Live Environment)**

* Deploy lightweight **agents** to continuously monitor active processes.
* Extract features **in near real-time** from process behavior.
* Feed live features into trained ML model.
* Model outputs **malicious / benign / suspicious** classification.

---

### **6. Response & Mitigation**

* If malicious:

  * **Alert security team / SOC.**
  * **Isolate process** (kill or sandbox).
  * **Block network traffic** linked to the process.
  * **Log evidence** for forensic analysis.
* If benign:

  * Allow normal execution.

---

### **7. Continuous Learning & Model Updating**

* Collect new malicious samples from runtime detection.
* Retrain or fine-tune models periodically.
* Use **online learning / federated learning** for adaptive detection.

✅ **Flow Summary:**
`Runtime Monitoring → Feature Extraction → Preprocessing → ML Classification → Real-Time Detection → Response → Model Update`
